JAPNKANJI


The client and advisor Amaha Ayaka is currently teaching introduction level Japanese in the Japanese Culture Foundation. She explained to me that the students in her class are having problem memorizing the kanji words, which is more complex alphabet than normal 26 letter Hiragana. She told me that when she teaches them the kanji letters student don’t have problem understanding the meaning but after one day they forget the letter or stroke order. She told me that this occurs because the student are young thus does not study at home. She asked for a computer game that challenges students ability to memorize kanji’s.

As the user of this educational software will be young students I suggested creating a game which involves competition which hopefully create ambition among students. This could be done by point mechanism and rewarding. In addition to that every question has time limit based on its level of hardness. We gathered at a café and Miss Ayaka stated that she liked the solution she also asked for a teacher interference which allows her to enter new kanji beside the pre-established kanji questions. The detail of the meeting is at Appendix.
